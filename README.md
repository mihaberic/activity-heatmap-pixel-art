# commit-heatmap-pixel-art
A fun project for generating a git history which draws pixel-art when displayed in an activity heat-map


# Inspiration for project:
- On Linkedin and other websites I often see posts about how it is important for people applying software engineering jobs, to have lots of green squares on the GitHub activity heatmap. This is meant to show that they write code often.
    - I have been working as a front-end developer in Angular for almost 4 years now. At 2 different companies, and I managed to get both these jobs without having public contributions on GitHub.
- I thought I would poke fun at this idea by generating fake commits to make my heatmap green.
- Famous saying: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
    - this saying, also called Goodhart's law, nicely explains this project, I suppose.

# Disclaimer
- This is just a joke project. Meant to prove a point. The point being that I like to code fun useless things :P
